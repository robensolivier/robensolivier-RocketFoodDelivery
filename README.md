<!-- The difference between Native and Cross-Platform mobile application. -->

# Native Mobile Apps

Native mobile apps are specifically developed for a single operating system, such as iOS (Apple) or Android (Google) providing high performance and seamless integration with the platform's UI/UX. They are written using platform-specific programming languages and tools, such as Swift/Objective-C for iOS and Java/Kotlin for Android, and they are designed to run natively on the target operating system

# Cross-platform Apps

Cross-platform apps are developed using frameworks that allow code reuse across multiple platforms, but may have limitations in terms of performance and platform-specific UX. Examples of popular cross-platform frameworks include React Native, Xamarin, and Flutter.

<!-- The difference between React Native and React. -->

React is used for building web interfaces, while React Native is used for building mobile apps. React renders components as HTML in web browsers, while React Native renders components as native UI elements on mobile devices.
React uses HTML-based components, while React Native uses platform-specific components like View, Text, Image, etc., which map to native UI elements on mobile devices.
Styling in React is typically done using CSS, while in React Native, styling is done using a combination of JavaScript and Flexbox layout, which is more similar to how CSS works in web development.
React apps are typically deployed to web browsers and accessed through URLs, while React Native apps are packaged as standalone apps and distributed through app stores, like the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
